        Write a Java program that asks user to enter a number
        if number is more than or equal to 10, then finish the program but
        if number is less than 10, keep asking user to enter a new number
        until user enters a number that is more than or equal to 10

        Example program:
        Program: Please enter a number
        User: 3

        Program: This number is not more than or equal to 10
        Program: Please enter a new number
        User: 8

        Program: This number is not more than or equal to 10
        Program: Please enter a new number
        User: 15

        Program: This number is more than or equal to 10
